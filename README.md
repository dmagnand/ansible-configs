In here, we have all configurations for non-Garuda systems. As Garuda dr460nized is pretty much my Arch setup, this repo contains only special dotfiles for Gentoo/pure Arch. 

- [GentooLTO](https://github.com/InBetweenNames/gentooLTO) portage config: most packages compiled with LTO and -O3 optimisations
- Systemd-nspawn containers with access to X server for running Arch packages on Gentoo such as the [Firedragon browser](https://github.com/dr460nf1r3/firedragon-browser)
- Kernel adapted for Lenovo T470, stripped down & with patches to use the CacULE scheduler & misc stuff are taken from [here](https://github.com/ptr1337/linux-cacule-aur)
- Approximately half of the packages is build from master branch using live ebuilds, because the more bleeding edge the better. Smart-live-rebuild for the win!
