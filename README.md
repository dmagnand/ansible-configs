In here, we have all configurations for non-Garuda systems. As Garuda dr460nized is pretty much my Arch setup, this repo contains only special dotfiles for Gentoo/Arch. 

- GentooLTO portage config -> most packages compiled with LTO and -O3 opimisations
- Systemd-nspawn containers for running Arch related stuff
- Kernel adapted for Lenovo T470, stripped down & with patches for CacULE scheduler & misc stuff are taken from (here)[https://github.com/ptr1337/linux-cacule-aur]
- Approximately half of the packages is build from master branch using live ebuilds, because the more bleeding edge the better
